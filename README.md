# Thought-Bubbles
Thought bubbles is a twist on a traditional to-do list. Instead of inputs going in a column, they go in different "thought bubbles". Users can add as many as they want, and delete thoughts by double-clicking the bubble.

How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JS
There is an event listener for the input function. Once input is entered, function addBubble starts, creating a new div (the bubble). This is then added to the main collection of bubbles

Lessons Learned:
Take your time with the pseudocode. Laying out even the tiniest of steps can be very helpful when something isn't working right

Improvements to Be Made:
Reducing white space and proper sizing of text in the bubbles
